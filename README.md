# Multiclass-Server

A custom EverQuest server project attempting to recreate and expand the multiclass features originally found on THJ.

These files include everything needed for both the client and server:

* Multiclass-Server-Client-Files.rar
* Server-Packet.rar  

For detailed installation instructions, see:

* Readme!!.txt in the Assets folder  
* The installation guide below

## Multiclass Server Installation Guide

---

### 1. PEQ Database Setup

**PEQ Backup Location**

The PEQ backup file is located in the Assets folder of your server files:

* thj_peq_backup.sql

**Importing the Database**

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing thj_peq_backup.sql.
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE thj_peq;"
mysql -u root -p thj_peq < thj_peq_backup.sql
```

**Login Credentials**

For out-of-the-box compatibility, use:

* user: root  
* password: root  

If you choose a different password, update it in the following files:

* eqemu_config.json  
* login.json  
* quests\migrate_bags.pl  
* quests\migrate_items.pl  

---

### 2. Client Setup

**Download the Client Files**

Download the Multiclass-Server Client Files from the GitHub release page:

https://github.com/Kraqurjak/Multiclass-Server-Release/releases/tag/V1.0

**Install the RoF2 Client**

* Download the RoF2 client from Steam or another source.  
* Exact links cannot be provided for copyright reasons.

**Apply the Multiclass Client Files**

1. Extract Multiclass-Server.Client.Files.rar.
2. Copy the extracted files into your RoF2 directory.
3. Overwrite all files when prompted.

**Configure eqhost.txt**

If you are running locally, use:

```text
[LoginServer]
Host=127.0.0.1:5999
```

If you are connecting remotely, change Host to match your server's IP and port.

Your client is now ready.

### 3. Server Setup

**Download the Server Packet**

Download the server package from the release page:

https://github.com/Kraqurjak/Multiclass-Server-Release/releases/tag/V1.0

This package includes:

* quests  
* plugins  
* spire  
* all required server scripts  

**Build the Server**

1. Run CMake to generate project files.
2. Compile the server in Release mode using Visual Studio.
3. Copy your compiled bin folder into the Server-Packet directory.

**Important: zlib-ng1.dll**

* Do not overwrite the zlib-ng1.dll included in the Server-Packet.  
* The server requires zlib-ng1.dll to run.

A backup copy is included in:

* Server-Packet/zlib-ng1 Backup/

If you delete or overwrite it, copy the backup into your bin directory.

**Final Step**

* Run the server executables (or Spire).  
* If your database and configuration files are correct, the server should start normally.

---

### Additional Notes

If you do not know how to compile the server, precompiled binaries are provided:

* Compiled-Server.rar

Place the contents of this archive into the bin folder inside the Server-Packet directory.

This is not required if you are compiling your own server.

THJ MULTICLASS SERVER - RELEASE NOTES
============================================================

Release 1 - 12/6/2025

Core Multiclass System
Multiclassing is fully implemented using a bitmask system.
All class checks (combat, spells, AAs, items, bonuses, etc.) now support multiclass logic.
Spell bars, spell book, scribing, and memorization now work for all classes you have unlocked.
Abilities and disciplines follow the same multiclass rules.
AA abilities can be used starting at level 51.

Item and Database Changes
All items in the database have been updated to ALL/ALL to support multiclass equipment rules.
You can equip any item that any of your 3 classes can use.
Evolving items do NOT work at this time.

Client and UI Notes
THJ client included (thj-client.rar).
Only the Default UI is currently supported. Other UIs will be fixed later.

Bazaar and Class Unlocking
Bazaar and Back AA recast time changed to 5 seconds. You can revert this in the database.

To begin multiclassing:
Go to the Bazaar.
Talk to two guild masters to choose your classes.
Add the Bazaar and Back AA to your hotbar.
Vision of Ayonae is unlocked and can be used freely to switch classes.

Zone and Instance Changes
Echo of the Past added to all THJ zones.
Respawning and non-respawning instances are working.
Bosses spawn correctly in non-respawning instances.
Lockouts have been removed or reduced.

New command: #respawn <seconds>
Example: #respawn 300 sets respawn to 5 minutes.
Example: #respawn 0 resets to normal spawn rate.

Travel and Waypoints
Waypoint unlocking removed.
Tearel (now a dragon) in Bazaar provides teleport popups to THJ zones and expeditions.

Progression and Quests
All progression quests are included but not yet updated for multiclass logic.
You may add or modify them as needed.

General Notes
A large amount of SQL rebuilding and server-side work was completed.
Multiclassing alone required weeks of fixes and rewrites.
This release is stable and ready for players.

AA System Updates
AAs can now be used starting at level 1.
AA class restrictions are bypassed when multiclassing is active.

Bard Fixes
Beneficial bard songs no longer fade instantly.

Multiclass Pet System (Major Feature)
A full multiclass pet system has been built from scratch.
You can now have multiple pets if you have more than one pet class.
Each pet is tracked, zoned, saved, and restored independently.
Pet AI, hate, assist, defend, and follow logic now iterate all pets.
Pet buffs work, but only the primary pet shows buff icons.
Extended target window does NOT auto-populate pets yet.
Pet UI only shows the primary pet (client limitation).

Two control systems now exist:

GLOBAL PET COMMANDS (affect all pets)
These are normal /pet commands, but now global:
/pet attack
/pet qattack

/pet follow
/pet guard
/pet regroup
/pet stop
/pet sit
/pet health
/pet getlost
All pets respond instantly.
